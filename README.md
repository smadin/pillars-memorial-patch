Small Xdelta patch to remove a transmisogynist message in Pillars of Eternity

The new game Pillars of Eternity by Obsidian includes "memorial" messages on in-game graves, as a Kickstarter backer reward. Unfortunately, Obsidian didn't vet the user-submitted messages well enough, and a transmisogynist "joke" ended up in the game. This is a small Xdelta patch to remove it.

This patch was generated with Xdelta 1.1. Xdelta is in a state of hosting flux at the moment due to the shutdown of Google Code, but versions up through 3.0f can still be found at http://sourceforge.net/projects/xdelta/.
